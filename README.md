In this experiment, the participants are prompted to press a series of 6 buttons, as fast as possible, in order from left to right. In between the button presses, a white flash can randomly appear, in the top and bottom of the screen. Participants are asked to ignore this flash.   

For the implementation of the task, jsPsych plugins were used and adapted. The experiment is meant to run on JATOS.
